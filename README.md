# Codedex-pwa
This is my Progressive Web App (PWA) for the website codex.io.

⸻

What it does
	•	The app helps with series downloading by opening a specific link with a colon and some URL (https://codedexpwa.netlify.app/)
	•	It’s still work in progress and not fully functional yet.
	•	The idea is to streamline the download process with this special link handler.

⸻

Current status
	•	The core functionality is not complete yet.
	•	You need to open that special link (with colon + URL) to start downloads.
	•	The UI and experience still need improvements.
